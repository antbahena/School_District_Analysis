# School_District_Analysis
## Module 4 Challenge
During this analysis I learned how crucial it can be to keep track of dfs as they can be re-used to chain columns together. This project has also shown me how difficult it can be to get results you need but how useful python can be in presenting data from a large data set. 
We are able to use many funtions to sort and clean data. This is useful when you are also trying to clean up data to be readable. It is for sure useful to recongize patterns and in this excercise it was taking those patterns and combining them in order to achieve the output that was needed.
